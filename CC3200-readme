## TI Software Installation
29	
The following TI software products must be installed in order to build and run the sample applications. While not strictly required, we recommend that you install these products into a common directory and that you use directory names without any whitespace. This documentation assumes that you haved installed everything in a directory named `C:/ti`.
30	
31	
- Install [Code Composer Studio v6.1.2](http://www.ti.com/tool/ccstudio?keyMatch=code%20composer%20studio) or higher.
32	
33	
- Install [TI-RTOS for CC32xx 2.16.00.08](http://downloads.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/tirtos/index.html) or higher.

## Build Environment Set Up
37	
### Updating Paths To Product Dependencies
38	
1. Edit the `products.mak` file in `<AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/` using your favorite text editor.
39	
2. Update the variables `XDC_INSTALL_DIR and TIRTOS_INSTALL_DIR to point to the locations where you installed these products.
40	
3. The variable `TI_ARM_CODEGEN_INSTALL_DIR` should point to the installation location of the TI ARM compiler in your CCS installation.
41	
4. After modification, these variable definitions should look similar to the following if you are working in Windows. (Windows users: note the use of "/" in the path).
42	
    ```
43	
    XDC_INSTALL_DIR = C:/ti/xdctools_3_32_00_06_core
44	
    TIRTOS_INSTALL_DIR = C:/ti/tirtos_cc32xx_2_16_00_08
45	
    TI_ARM_CODEGEN_INSTALL_DIR = C:/ti/ccsv6/tools/compiler/ti-cgt-arm_5.2.5
46	
    ```
47	
48	
### Notes On The gmake Utiltity
49	
When building an application for the first time, the TI ARM compiler first builds the C runtime library, which requires that ```gmake``` is on the environment path. It is therefore recommended that the ```gmake``` tool be installed on your machine and added to the environment path.
50	
51	
Alternatively, the XDCtools product (```C:/ti/xdctools_3_32_00_06_core```) contains ```gmake```, which can be utilized by adding the install location of XDCtools to the environment path. But note, it is recommended that the XDCtools is removed from the path after the inital step of building the C runtime libraries is complete. This is to avoid conflicts when you use newer versions of XDCtools.
52	
53	
For detailed information about building TI ARM C runtime library, please read the [Mklib wiki](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Mklib).

## AWS IoT Installation And Set Up
57	
### AWS IoT SDK Installation
58	
This procedure assumes you have already installed the AWS SDK on your development machine. These instructions refer to the folder that contains the AWS SDK on your local machine as `<AWS_INSTALL_DIR>`.
59	
60	
### AWS IoT Developer Set Up
61	
In order to run the sample applications, it is necessary to complete the steps of the [AWS IoT Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html).  In particular, the following steps of the guide must be completed:
62	
1. [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
63	
2. [Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
64	
3. [Sign in to the AWS IoT Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-console-signin.html)
65	
4. [Create a Device in the Thing Registry](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device.html)
66	
5. [Create and Activate a Device Certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html)
67	
    - Make sure you choose to download the certificate files, as these will be needed in the [Building The Certificate Flasher Tool](#Build-TOOL) steps.
68	
    - Note: you will also need a root CA certificate.  You can download the root CA from [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/identity-in-iot.html).  Just search for the link titled "VeriSign root CA certificate"
69	
6. [Create an AWS IoT Policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-iot-policy.html)
70	
7. [Attach an AWS IoT Policy to a Device Certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/attach-policy-to-certificate.html)
71	
8. [Attach a Thing to a Certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/attach-cert-thing.html)
72	
73	
Note that Amazon has recently tailored the [AWS IoT Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html) instructions specifically for the "AWS IoT Button."  You can ignore the mentions of the button as your TI embedded device will be used in place of this.  For more details on AWS IoT, please refer to the [What Is AWS IoT](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html) page.

## Obtain The Certificate Files
77	
Certificate files used by the samples need to be obtained from the AWS CLI tool and the AWS IoT website directly. If you have not already done so, follow the steps in the previous section to set up your thing, certificates and policy.
78

80	
## Building The Certificate Flasher Tool
81	
82	
1. Open the file `certflasher.c` from the directory `<AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/samples/tirtos/certs/cc3200`.
83	
84	
2. Search for "USER STEP" and update the CA root certificate string, the client certificate string, and the client (private) key string. These should be extracted from certificate (.pem) files downloaded from AWS (remember to remove the newline '\n' characters in the JSON data). A typical string would be of this format:
85	
86	
    ```
87	
    const char root_ca_pem[] =
88	
    "JQQGEwJVUzEQMA4GA1UECAwHTW9udGFuYTEQMA4GA1UEBwwHQm96ZW1hbjERMA8G"
89	
    "A1UECgwIU2F3dG9vdGgxEzARBgNVBAsMCkNvbnN1bHRpbmcxGDAWBlNVBAMMD3d3"
90	
    "dy53b2xmc3NsLmNvbTEfMB0GCSqGSIb3DQEJARYQaW5mb0B3b2xmc3NsLmNvbTAe"
91	
    "Fw0xNTA1MDcxODIxMDFaFw0xOGAxMzExODIxMDFaMIGUMQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzEQ"
92	
    "MA4GA1UECAwHTW9udGFuYTEQMA4GA1UEBwwHQm96ZW1hbjERMA8GA1UECgwIU2F3"
93	
    "dG9vdGgxEzARBgNVBAsMCkNvbnN1bHRpbmcxGDAWBgNVBAMMD3d3dy53b2xmc3Ns"
94	
    "LmNvbTEfMB0GCSqGSIb3DQEJARYQaW5mb0B3b2xmy3NsLmNvbTCCASIwDQYJKoZI"
95	
    "hvcNAQEBBQADggEPADCCAQoCggEBAL8Myi0Ush6EQlvNOB9K8k11EPG2NZ/fyn0D"
96	
    "mNOs3gNm7irx2LB9bgdUCxCYIU2AyxIg58xP3kV9yXJ3MurKkLtpUhADL6jzlcXx";
97	
    ```
98	
Note that certificate files must be name "ca.der", "cert.der" and "key.der", and written to the "/cert" directory (as shown in the certflasher application source file).  The ability to change these names and their location will be added in a future release.
99	
100	
On the command line, enter the following commands to build the application:
101	
102	
    cd <AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/samples/tirtos/certs/cc3200
103	
    C:/ti/xdctools_3_32_00_06_core/gmake all
104	
105	
<a name="Build-SAMPLE"></a>
106	
## Building The Sample Applications
107	
108	
Before building a specific application, complete the following steps (we are referring to the `subscribe_publish_sample` application here, but the same procedure applies to other samples as well):
109	
110	
1. If you are using Windows, open a Windows command prompt. If you are using Linux, open a terminal window.
111	
2. Use the following AWS CLI command to to retrieve your AWS account-specific AWS IoT endpoint:
112	
```aws iot describe-endpoint```
113	
3. Open the `aws_iot_config.h` file from the directory `<AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/samples/tirtos/subscribe_publish_sample/cc3200` in a text editor
114	
4. Update the value of the macro "AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST" with string output from this command (for example, it will have a format similar to the following: `<random-string>.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)
115	
5. Update the value of the macro "AWS_IOT_MQTT_CLIENT_ID" to a unique name for your device
116	
6. Update the value of the macro "AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME" with the name of the thing you created during the steps on the [Create a Device in the Thing Registry](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device.html) web page
117	
118	
7. The certificate file variables "AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_FILENAME", "AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_FILENAME", and "AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME" are not used in this release and should be left as is here.  Certificate file placement is handled by the certificate flasher tool in the next section.
119	
120	
8. Open the file `wificonfig.h` from the directory `<AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/samples/tirtos/subscribe_publish_sample/cc3200`. Search for "USER STEP" and update the WIFI SSID and SECURITY_KEY macros.
121	
122	
On the command line, enter the following commands to build the application:
123	
124	
    cd <AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/samples/tirtos/subscribe_publish_sample/cc3200
125	
    C:/ti/xdctools_3_32_00_06_core/gmake all
126	
127

128	
## Setting Up Code Composer Studio Before Running The Samples
129	
1. Plug the CC3200 Launchpad into a USB port on your PC
130	
131	
2. Open a serial session to the appropriate COM port with the following settings:
132	
133	
    ```
134	
    Baudrate:     9600
135	
    Data bits:       8
136	
    Stop bits:       1
137	
    Parity:       None
138	
    Flow Control: None
139	
    ```
140	
141	
3. Open Code Composer Studio.
142	
143	
4. In Code Composer Studio, open the CCS Debug Perspective - Windows menu -> Open Perspective -> CCS Debug
144	
145	
5. Open the Target Configurations View - Windows menu -> Show View -> Target Configurations
146	
147	
6. Right-click on User Defined. Select New Target Configuration.
148	
149	
7. Use `CC3200.ccxml` as "File name". Hit Finish.
150	
151	
8. In the Basic window, select "Stellaris In-Circuit Debug Interface" as the "Connection", and check the box next to "CC3200" in "Board or Device". Hit Save.
152	
153	
9. Right-click "CC3200.ccxml" in the Target Configurations View. Hit Launch Selected Configuration.
154	
155	
10. Under the Debug View, right-click on "Stellaris In-Circuit Debug Interface_0/Cortex_M4_0". Select "Connect Target".

158	
## Running The Certificate Flasher Tool
159	
All samples rely on a set of certificates from AWS. As a result, the certificates need to be stored once into flash memory prior to running the samples. To flash the certificates, simply run the flasher tool you have previously [built](#Build-TOOL) using this procedure:
160	
161	
1. Select Run menu -> Load -> Load Program..., and browse to the file `certflasher.out` in `<AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/samples/tirtos/certs/cc3200`. Hit OK. This will load the program onto the board.
162	
163	
2. Run the application by pressing F8. The output in the CCS Console looks as follows:
164	
165	
    ```
166	
    Flashing ca certificate file ...
167	
    Flashing client certificate file ...
168	
    Flashing client key file ...
169	
    done.
170	
    ```
171	
172	
3. Hit Alt-F8 (Suspend) to halt the CPU.
173	
174

175	
## Running A Sample
176	
1. Disconnect and reconnect the CC3200's USB cable to power cycle the hardware, and then reconnect in CCS.  For best results, it is recommended to do this before loading and running an application every time, in order to reset the CC3200's network processor.
177	
178	
2. Select Run menu -> Load -> Load Program..., and browse to the file `subscribe_publish_sample.out` in `<AWS_INSTALL_DIR>/samples/tirtos/subscribe_publish_sample/cc3200`. Hit OK. This will load the program onto the board. (The same procedure applies to other samples by substituting `subscribe_publish_sample`)
179	
180	
3. Run the application by pressing F8. The output will appear in your serial terminal session:
181	
182	
    ```
183	
    CC3200 has connected to AP and acquired an IP address.
184	
    IP Address: 192.168.1.130
